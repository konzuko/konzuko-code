TODO
---

- debugging button - which only returns solutions to fixes but not code
also explores how the error may have occured and future problems and fixes if we go on
versus if we refactor

- new feature button - with a prompt that explores the path to the feature, inlcuding potential problems and clashes with current code
(will need to figure out how this will fit in with the current Develop button)
