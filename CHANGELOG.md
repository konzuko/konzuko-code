- FIX prompts 

- edit button
- commit button
- specift kind of codebase
- token warning signal
- continue chat button
{ summary needs to identify fixes done so far, struggles user has had, and latest full code file}
- fix grid
- TOKEN COUNTER IS FUCKED - FIX IT


- debugging button - which only returns solutions to fixes but not code
also explores how the error may have occured and future problems and fixes if we go on
versus if we refactor

- new feature button - with a prompt that explores the path to the feature, inlcuding potential problems and clashes with current code
(will need to figure out how this will fit in with the current Develop button)


- ability to specify and save to one particular file per chat - a kind of @list.html for example - should eb able to select it from the system file menu
the idea being that you're generally working on a per file basis

- a small llm that check if your prompt makes sense before it's sent - under the hood
